# RPNCalcProject

Due to the cost of reverse polish notation (RPN) calculators, I wanted to make the attempt at creating one myself.
I would do this all from scratch making my own PCB, creating my own code, and figuring out how to create a calculator-like case.

I want to go ahead and do this with the MSP430G2533 Microcontroller since I have a development board with me with that MCU.
